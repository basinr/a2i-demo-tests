    "In this tutorial, we will be showing you how you can use AWS Augmented AI (A2) directly with your calls to Textract's Analyze Document API. For more in depth instructions, visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html#a2i-getting-started-prerequisites (**note**: the Prerequisites on this site must be completed prior to beginning this tutorial)\n",

    "To incorporate Amazon A2I into your data labeling workflow for all task types, you need three resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **worker task template** to create a worker UI. The worker UI displays your input data, such as documents or images, and instructions to workers. It also provides interactive tools that the worker uses to complete your tasks. For more information, see Create a Worker UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human review workflow**, also referred to as a flow definition. You use the flow definition to configure your human workforce and provide information about how to accomplish the labeling task. For built-in task types, you also use the flow definition to identify the conditions under which a review human loop is triggered. For example, Amazon Rekognition can perform image content moderation using machine learning. You can use the flow definition to specify that an image will be sent to a human for content moderation review if Amazon Rekognition's confidence is too low. You can create a flow definition in the Amazon SageMaker console or with the Amazon SageMaker API. To learn more about both of these options, see Create a Flow Definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human loop** to start your human review workflow. When you use one of the built-in task types, the corresponding AWS service creates and starts a human loop on your behalf when the conditions specified in your flow definition are met or for each object if no conditions were specified. When a human loop is triggered, human review tasks are sent to the workers as specified in the flow definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a custom task type, you start a human loop using the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API. When you call StartHumanLoop in your custom application, a task is sent to human reviewers."
